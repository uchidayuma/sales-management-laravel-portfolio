## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### Laravel Sail (Docker) Environment

This project uses Laravel Sail for a simple, portable development environment.

**Prerequisites**
- Docker Desktop
- PHP & Composer (locally) OR use the `sail` alias if PHP is not installed locally.

**Installation Steps**

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd sales-management-laravel
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```
3.  **Configure Environment**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Sail uses .env variables to configure Docker containers
    ```
4.  **Start Sail**
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
    ```
5.  **Setup Application**
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate
    ./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate:fresh --seed
    ```
6.  **Build Frontend**
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail npm install
    ./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev
    ```

**Accessing the Application**

-   **Web App**: `http://localhost`
-   **Mailpit** (Email Testing): `http://localhost:8025`
-   **MySQL**: Port `3306`
-   **Redis**: Port `6379`

### Default Login Credentials

The `migrate:fresh --seed` command sets up the following test users.
**All passwords are:** `password`

| User Type | Email | Password |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Admin (本部)** | `admin@example.com` | `password` |
| **FC (店舗)** | `user2@example.com` | `password` |
| **FC (その他)** | `user3@example.com` | `password` |

*Note: For more users, check `database/seeds/UsersTableSeeder.php`.*

### Playwright E2E Tests

This project uses **Playwright** for End-to-End (E2E) testing.

**Prerequisites**

- Node.js (Latest LTS version recommended)
- NPM

**Installation**

    ```

**Running Tests**

Run all E2E tests:
```bash
npx playwright test
```

Run specific test file:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/e2e/user_flow.spec.js
```

**Viewing Reports**

View the HTML report of the last test run:
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## 📝 Code Quality

This project follows:
- **PSR-2** coding standards
- **PSR-4** autoloading
- Laravel best practices
- Clean code principles

## 🌟 Why This Project Stands Out

1. **Production-Ready**: This is not a tutorial project - it's a real system handling actual business operations
2. **Complex Business Logic**: Implements sophisticated workflows for franchise management
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle growing data and user base
4. **Modern PHP**: Uses PHP 8.0+ features and best practices
5. **Well-Documented**: Clean, readable code with comprehensive documentation
